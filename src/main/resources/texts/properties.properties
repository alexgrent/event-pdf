overrepresentation=This is an <b>overrepresentation</b> analysis: A statistical (hypergeometric distribution) test that determines whether certain Reactome pathways are over-represented (enriched) in the submitted data. It answers the question ‘Does my list contain more proteins for pathway X than would be expected by chance?’ This test produces a probability score, which is corrected for false discovery rate using the Benjamani-Hochberg method.
expression=This is an <b>expression</b> analysis: The numbers are used to produce a scaled coloured overlay over Reactome pathway diagrams, as a means to visualize relative expression levels. Note that the numeric values do not have to be expression data, for instance by using gene association scores the same analysis can be used to visualize genotyping results.
species_comparison=This is a <b>species comparison</b> analysis: It compares human pathways with computationally-predicted pathways in model organisms, highlighting the elements of the pathway that are common to both species and those that may be absent in the model organism.

padog=This is a gene set analysis method: A method that tests for differential expression directly on the pathway level. PADOG is a weighted gene set analysis approach that down-weighs genes that are present in many pathways.
camera=This is a gene set analysis method: A method that tests for differential expression directly on the pathway level. Camera uses linear models for the differential expression analysis. This has the advantage that it can take confounding parameters (for example the patient) into consideration.
ssgsea=This is a gene set <b>variation</b> analysis. It maps the gene or protein level expression values onto the pathway level. The result is one expression value per pathway and sample. It is especially useful if you cannot assign your samples to specific groups or when you want to correlate pathway expression with continuous parameters (such as survival time).

identifiers.found=%d out of %d identifiers in the sample were found in Reactome, where %d pathways were hit by at least one of them.
projected=All non-human identifiers have been converted to their human equivalent.
interactors=IntAct interactors were included to increase the analysis background. This greatly increases the size of Reactome pathways, which maximises the chances of matching your submitted identifiers to the expanded pathway, but will include interactors that have not undergone manual curation by Reactome and may include interactors that have no biological significance, or unexplained relevance.
target.species.resource=This report is filtered to show only results for species '%s' and resource '%s'.
token=The unique ID for this analysis (token) is %s. This ID is valid for at least 7 days in Reactome’s server. Use it to access Reactome services with your data.
fireworks.caption=This figure shows a genome-wide overview of the results of your pathway analysis. Reactome pathways are arranged in a hierarchy. The center of each of the circular "bursts" is the root of one top-level pathway, for example "DNA Repair". Each step away from the center represents the next level lower in the pathway hierarchy. The color code denotes over-representation of that pathway in your input dataset. Light grey signifies pathways which are not significantly over-represented.
introduction=Reactome is open-source, open access, manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database. Pathway annotations are authored by expert biologists, in collaboration with Reactome editorial staff and cross-referenced to many bioinformatics databases. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature. Reactome is used by clinicians, geneticists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.<br>The development of Reactome is supported by grants from the US National Institutes of Health (P41 HG003751), University of Toronto (CFREF Medicine by Design), European Union (EU STRP, EMI-CD), and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EBI Industry program).
