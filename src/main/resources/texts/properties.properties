overrepresentation=This is an <b>overrepresentation</b> analysis: A statistical (hypergeometric distribution) test that determines whether certain Reactome pathways are over-represented (enriched) in the submitted data. It answers the question ‘Does my list contain more proteins for pathway X than would be expected by chance?’ This test produces a probability score, which is corrected for false discovery rate using the Benjamani-Hochberg method.
expression=This is an <b>expression</b> analysis: The numbers are used to produce a scaled coloured overlay over Reactome pathway diagrams, as a means to visualize relative expression levels. Note that the numeric values do not have to be expression data, for instance by using gene association scores the same analysis can be used to visualize genotyping results.
species_comparison=This is a <b>species comparison</b> analysis: It compares human pathways with computationally-predicted pathways in model organisms, highlighting the elements of the pathway that are common to both species and those that may be absent in the model organism.
identifiers.found=%d out of %d identifiers in the sample were found in Reactome, where %d pathways were hit by at least one of them.
projected=All non-human identifiers have been converted to their human equivalent.
interactors=IntAct interactors were included to increase the analysis background. This greatly increases the size of Reactome pathways, which maximises the chances of matching your submitted identifiers to the expanded pathway, but will include interactors that have not undergone manual curation by Reactome and may include interactors that have no biological significance, or unexplained relevance.
target.species.resource=This report is filtered to show only results for species '%s' and resource '%s'.
token=The unique ID for this analysis (token) is %s. This ID is valid for at least 7 days in Reactome’s server. Use it to access Reactome services with your data.
fireworks.caption=This figure shows a genome-wide overview of the results of your pathway analysis. Reactome pathways are arranged in a hierarchy. The center of each of the circular "bursts" is the root of one top-level pathway, for example "DNA Repair". Each step away from the center represents the next level lower in the pathway hierarchy. The color code denotes over-representation of that pathway in your input dataset. Light grey signifies pathways which are not significantly over-represented.
introduction=Reactome is a curated database of pathways and reactions in human biology. Reactions can be considered as pathway 'steps'. Reactome defines a 'reaction' as any event in biology that changes the state of a biological molecule. Binding, activation, translocation, degradation and classical biochemical events involving a catalyst are all reactions. Information in the database is authored by expert biologists, entered and maintained by Reactome’s team of curators and editorial staff. Reactome content frequently cross-references other resources e.g. NCBI, Ensembl, UniProt, KEGG (Gene and Compound), ChEBI, PubMed and GO. Orthologous reactions inferred from annotation for Homo sapiens are available for 17 non-human species including mouse, rat, chicken, puffer fish, worm, fly, yeast, rice, and Arabidopsis. Pathways are represented by simple diagrams following an SBGN-like format.<br>Reactome's annotated data describe reactions possible if all annotated proteins and small molecules were present and active simultaneously in a cell. By overlaying an experimental dataset on these annotations, a user can perform a pathway over-representation analysis. By overlaying quantitative expression data or time series, a user can visualize the extent of change in affected pathways and its progression. A binomial test is used to calculate the probability shown for each result, and the p-values are corrected for the multiple testing (Benjamini–Hochberg procedure) that arises from evaluating the submitted list of identifiers against every pathway.<br>To learn more about our Pathway Analysis, please have a look at our relevant publications:
cover.page=This report contains the pathway analysis results for the submitted sample '%s'. Analysis was performed against Reactome version %d on %s. The web link to these results is:<br><a href="%s">%s</a><br>Please keep in mind that analysis results are temporarily stored on our server. The storage period depends on usage of the service but is at least 7 days. As a result, please note that this URL is only valid for a limited time period and it might have expired.
identifiers.found.section=Below is a list of the input identifiers that have been found or mapped to an equivalent element in Reactome, classified by resource.
most.significant.pathways=The following table shows the %d most relevant pathways sorted by p-value.
pathways.detail=For every pathway of the most significant pathways, we present its diagram, as well as a short summary, its bibliography and the list of inputs found in it.
identifiers.not.found.section=These %d identifiers were not found neither mapped to any entity in Reactome.
