overrepresentation=This is an <b>overrepresentation</b> analysis: A statistical (hypergeometric distribution) test that determines whether certain Reactome pathways are over-represented (enriched) in the submitted data. It answers the question ‘Does my list contain more proteins for pathway X than would be expected by chance?’ This test produces a probability score, which is corrected for false discovery rate using the Benjamani-Hochberg method.
expression=This is an <b>expression</b> analysis: The numbers are used to produce a scaled coloured overlay over Reactome pathway diagrams, as a means to visualize relative expression levels. Note that the numeric values do not have to be expression data, for instance by using gene association scores the same analysis can be used to visualize genotyping results.
species_comparison=This is a <b>species comparison</b> analysis: It compares human pathways with computationally-predicted pathways in model organisms, highlighting the elements of the pathway that are common to both species and those that may be absent in the model organism.
identifiers.found=%d out of %d identifiers in the sample were found in Reactome, where %d pathways were hit by at least one of them.
projected=All non-human identifiers have been converted to their human equivalent.
interactors=IntAct interactors were included to increase the analysis background. This greatly increases the size of Reactome pathways, which maximises the chances of matching your submitted identifiers to the expanded pathway, but will include interactors that have not undergone manual curation by Reactome and may include interactors that have no biological significance, or unexplained relevance.
target.species.resource=This report is filtered to show only results for species '%s' and resource '%s'.
token=The unique ID for this analysis (token) is %s. This ID is valid for at least 7 days in Reactome’s server. Use it to access Reactome services with your data.
fireworks.caption=This figure shows a genome-wide overview of the results of your pathway analysis. Reactome pathways are arranged in a hierarchy. The center of each of the circular "bursts" is the root of one top-level pathway, for example "DNA Repair". Each step away from the center represents the next level lower in the pathway hierarchy. The color code denotes over-representation of that pathway in your input dataset. Light grey signifies pathways which are not significantly over-represented.
introduction=Reactome is an open-source, open access, manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database. Pathway annotations are authored by expert biologists, in collaboration with Reactome editorial staff and cross-referenced to many bioinformatics databases. These include NCBI Entrez Gene, Ensembl and UniProt databases, the UCSC and HapMap Genome Browsers, the KEGG Compound and ChEBI small molecule databases, PubMed, and Gene Ontology. <br>The development of Reactome is supported by an EU STRP, EMI-CD grant from the European Union, the EBI Industry program and grant P41 HG003751 from the National Human Genome Research Institute at the US National Institutes of Health.
